# Text Data Cleaning for NLP Tasks

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **Text Data Cleaning** project, where we tackle the messy side of text data in NLP. This repository contains a collection of Python functions designed to clean up text data, making it ready for natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and more.

## What does this project do? ðŸ¤”

This project helps you clean text by removing unwanted elements such as:

- URLs
- Time and date expressions
- Hashtags
- Emails
- Non-UTF8 characters
- Anything between parentheses (or other defined tags)

We also included a function to detect if the text is in English!
